<font size="2" face="Segoe UI">In this article I will be discussing about the following:</font>

  * <font size="2" face="Segoe UI">Self-Signed Certificate</font>
  * <font size="2" face="Segoe UI">Root CA Certificate</font>
  * <font size="2" face="Segoe UI">Intermediate CA Certificate</font>

At the end I would like everyone to be able to differentiate between these certificate types.

<font size="5" face="Segoe UI"><strong><u>Self Signed Certificate</u></strong></font>

<font size="2" face="Segoe UI">Self Signed Certificates are certs where both the <strong>Issued To </strong>and the <strong>Issued By </strong>field of the certificates are same. In simple words it is a certificate where one issues a certificate to itself and hence the name <strong>Self Signed Certificate</strong>. Here is one example:</font>

<a href="https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/01/38/03/metablogapi/1145.image_6FB37409.png" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-38-03-metablogapi/1145.image_5F00_6FB37409.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="image" src="https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/01/38/03/metablogapi/6318.image_thumb_39624BFA.png" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-38-03-metablogapi/6318.image_5F00_thumb_5F00_39624BFA.png" width="398" height="494" /></a>

<font size="2" face="Segoe UI">As seen in the above image the <strong>Issued to</strong> and <strong>Issued by </strong>are same. You may also observe the warning indicating that the certificate is not trusted. Of course it is not as it is self-signed, none of the Known Public CAâ€™s have issued this, so it wont be trusted. </font>

   <font size="2" face="Segoe UI"></p> 

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="420" align="center" bgcolor="#778899" border="2">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="416">
      <p>
        <font size="2" face="Segoe UI"><strong>NOTE</strong>: To get past the above error put the cert in the Root CA store.</font>&#160;
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  These certs come in handy as they can be created easily using several tools. Obtaining a certificate from a noted Certification Authority has a cost associated with it and may not be feasible at all times. Developers typically test their applications using a self signed certificates most of the times.
</p>

<p>
  <strong><u><font size="5">Root CA Certificate</font></u></strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Root CA </strong>Certificate is a <strong>CA </strong>Certificate which is simply a <strong>Self-signed Certificate</strong>. This certificate represents a entity which issues certificate and is known as <strong>Certificate Authority </strong>or the <strong>CA</strong>. The usage of the certificate distinguishes it with other normal certificates. Now a CA can be classified as either <strong>Root CAâ€™s</strong> or <strong>Intermediate CAâ€™s</strong>. On a <strong>Windows OS</strong>, if you are looking at the certificate store, you would see all the Root CA certificates in the <strong>Trusted Root Certification Authorities</strong>. This by default includes the list of public root CAâ€™s which are installed with Windows and are updated periodically through Windows Updates. The number of the certificates would be lesser.
</p>

    <strong><u>Identification of a Root CA:</u></strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now how do we differentiate the CA certificates as <strong>Root CA</strong> or <strong>Intermediate CA</strong>. There is so much fuss around this. Its actually easy, look at the CA cert. If the <strong>Issued to</strong> and <strong>Issued by </strong>are same then it is a <strong>Root CA </strong>or else it is a <strong>Intermediate CA</strong>. Another identification would be to look at the <strong>Certification Path</strong>. The Cert which appears at the top of the list is the <strong>Root CA</strong>. Below is one example of one of the public root CAâ€™s:
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you think logically this makes sense. CAâ€™s are supposed to issue certificates. Now if I start the process from the beginning, then someone has to issue a certificate to himself and then start the process of issuing the certs down the line.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Iâ€™m not going to discuss the purpose of the CA certificate as that would lead to a whole new discussion altogether.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><u><font size="5">Intermediate CA Certificate</font></u></strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Intermediate CA </strong>Certificate is a CA certificate which is not a <strong>Self-signed Certificate</strong>. The purpose of this certificate may be same as the Root CA or different. Now one may think why to have a intermediate CA at all. Well here is what I think:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Initially it may not require to have a Intermediate CA, as the Root CAâ€™s will serve the purpose. However as the requirement for PKI increases so would the number of CAâ€™s. Understanding that CA at the end of the day is a Server Machine performing this computational task, it is required to have multiple machines. So they have to be replicated. Now it is again not viable to have many Root CAâ€™s in the case of a Internet Scenario as this could lead to fraud and other management issues. So the concept of Intermediate CA was introduced. The Root CAâ€™s delegated their tasks to the corresponding Intermediate CAâ€™s for this. This way they can have one or more Intermediate CAâ€™s.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On <strong>Windows OS</strong>, these certificates can be found in the <strong>Intermediate Certification Authorities </strong>Store. Comparatively the number of certificates in this store would be more compared to <strong>Trusted Root Certification Authorities </strong>store.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Below is a image of a certificate store of <strong>MY </strong>or <strong>Local Computer</strong> account. It contains many certificate stores, but I have only highlighted the ones relevant to this article.
